Implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm by Viola &amp; Jones.

To run this project, first run the download.py script. This will download the faceScrub dataset into the actors/ directory.
 ```python
 python ./faceScrub download.py
 ```
To run the AdaBoost algorithm and find the best classifiers, run the main.py file. Make sure to read the comments and comment/uncomment code to create a new dataset or use the exisiting one.
 ```python
